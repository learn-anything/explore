# Explore

> Trying things

Goal of the repo is exploration of all kinds of things. LLM research, frameworks testing, etc.

Plus it's used as place to keep WIP code for LA until it's production ready.

Code tested/explored here can be turned into a [task](https://github.com/learn-anything/tasks) or integrated into [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz) itself.

## Contribute

Always open to useful ideas or fixes in form of issues or PRs.

Can [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) (search [existing issues](../../issues) first) or [start discussion](../../discussions).

It's okay to submit draft PR as you can get help along the way to make it merge ready.
